Predicting the performance, effect, and improvement that NBA rookies from the NCAA have on their team 

Abstract: While the skills of the team may determine the outcome of a basketball season, many other factors are also at play. In particular, the NBA draft is perhaps one of the most anticipated sport events every year and decisions are often scrutinized. This project attempts to explore how NBA teams are affected by their college recruits, and how a team might improve due to the addition of a player. Specifically, we will explore a few methods in which one can predict how a college player will impact an NBA teamâ€™s record in their first season.
